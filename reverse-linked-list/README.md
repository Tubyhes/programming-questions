## Reversing a Linked List

To take on this challenge:

```
cp src/empty.c src/your_name.c
```

Implement your reverseLinkedList implementation so that it will reverse the list allocated in main.c.

Compile with:

```
gcc main.c src/your_name.c -I. -o your_name.out
```

Run with:
```
./your_name.out
```

Output should look like this:
```
v = 1, v = 2, v = 3, v = 4, v = 5, v = 6, v = 7, v = 8, v = 9, v = 10, 
v = 10, v = 9, v = 8, v = 7, v = 6, v = 5, v = 4, v = 3, v = 2, v = 1, 
```
